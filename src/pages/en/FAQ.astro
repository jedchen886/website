          'First check if the remote control is turned on and connected to the robot, then verify that the emergency stop button on the robot is released. If the above checks are fine, follow the remote control operating instructions to confirm that the remote control mode settings are correct.',

        description:
          "First check if the remote control is turned on. Generally, the remote control has the highest priority. If the remote control is on, you can either turn off the remote control or set the remote control mode switch to the middle position for remote braking functionality while also supporting host computer communication.",

          "Check if the robotic arm system network is working properly by pinging the arm's IP address. Use the teach pendant software panel to check the cause of the problem. Restart the robotic arm system and confirm if the issue persists.",

          "Ensure the robotic arm is in normal state. The gripper will automatically perform an open/close self-test 5 seconds after power-on. You can unplug and replug the connector cable between the arm and gripper to repower the gripper.",
