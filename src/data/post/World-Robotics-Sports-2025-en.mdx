The 2025 World Humanoid Robot Sports Games is the world's first comprehensive event focused on humanoid robots, co-hosted by the Beijing Municipal Government of China and multiple organizations. It includes three major categories - competitive events, performance events, and scenario events - with 26 projects, held from August 14-17, 2025 at China's National Speed Skating Oval (Ice Ribbon) in Beijing. A total of 280 teams from 16 countries participated in the 26 competition events.

Three teams from the Dora Robot team used Adora 2 Pro to participate in the opening ceremony and medication sorting competition events. The Adora 2 Pro robot performed excellently during the events, withstanding the test of multiple rounds of competition. At the same time, through competition and peer exchanges, we also identified many shortcomings and areas for improvement, which we will continue to optimize and improve to enhance performance and stability.
